# EZ-Monitor

EZ-Monitor is a Linux system monitoring tool that uses SSH connections to query for information
from a set of provided hosts. This allows you to get valuable information without the need
for a dedicated agent on every server.

## Usage

All you need to get started is to define an inventory file of and then start up EZ-Monitor via the CLI.

See an example inventory file below

```ini
[host-1]
address=ubuntu-server-1
username=some-user
ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

[host-2]
address=ubuntu-server-2
username=some-user
password=lets-avoid-defining-passwords-in-plain-text-if-we-can-:)
port=23
```

Inventory files are defined in an `ini` format where every `[section]` defined in brackets signifies a host entry. The
section name servers as an alias for each host. From there, the following connection information is supported.

- address
- username
- password
- ssh_private_key_file
- port

There's currently no support for hashing passwords so it is recommended that you be extremely careful if you define them
in your inventory files.

Once you have your inventory file defined, simply run `ez-monitor` with a path to your inventory supplied as an argument.

```bash
ez-monitor inventory.ini
```

## Installation

### MacOS
If you have HomeBrew installed, use the tap shown below.

```bash
brew tap kreulenk/brew
brew install ez-monitor
```

### Linux
Navigate to the Releases section of EZ-Monitor's GitHub repository and download the latest tar for your
processor architecture. Then, untar the executable and move it to `/usr/local/bin/ez-monitor`.

E.g.
```
curl -OL https://github.com/kreulenk/ez-monitor/releases/download/v0.3.0/ez-monitor-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ez-monitor-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv ./ez-monitor /usr/local/bin/ez-monitor
```

### Build From Source

Ensure that you have at least Go 1.24 installed on your system.

Then, run
```bash
make install
```
